# Why I started infinity.
Lets go back a few years. Ever since the first glimpse from Corellium that they got Android up and running, I was facinated and had to get a taste.

But.. Things just didnt go to plan for me. I didn't have the tools and knowledge required. So, as you would've expected everything I tried just failed.

Fast forward a few years to only a few months ago. I decided to give it one last shot and it didn't work. So I reached out to the r/jailbreak Discord server and let's call this man "helpfuldude", helpfuldude reached out to me and offered assistance so I can get it up and running. And.. I did! I got it working! Android was on my iPhone! 

I came up with an idea. odysseyn1x has a project sandcaslte menu.. What if I clone odysseyn1x and use that as my base? So I did. I cloned it and started developing what was called at the time "sandcaslten1x"  but then later renamed to what it is today. After weeks of testing and headaches. It was done. So I uploaded it to GitHub, told a few people about it and they were like "oh yeah it works oh its cool" but after that there was no more talk about it. 

AND HERE COME THE REDDIT LORDS AFTER POSTING MY RELEASE, IT STARTED GAINING TRACTION AND BIG TIME. THEY LISTENED TO MY PRAYERS AND PROMOTED MY POST TO THE TOP OF THE SUBREDDIT!

And.. that's it. That's the whole story. Thank you very much helpfuldude for guiding me!
